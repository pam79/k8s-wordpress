# Learn Kubernetes with exercises

In this repository you will find 5 exercises that will help you learn Kubernetes.

You will start by deploying a simple MySQL container on a Kubernetes cluster then add capabilities until having a full WordPress web application deployed that has resiliencies to container restarts or outages.

<u>**Pre-Requisites**</u>: In order to do those exercises, you will need to have a Kubernetes Cluster deployed and have the ```kubectl``` command installed on your machine. 

You will find how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on this page [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough)
